This is a personal setup website of Unica Cai, a second year undergraduate from [School of Public Management](https://spm.ecnu.edu.cn/), [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/). My major is human resource management and now focusing on organizational behavior. I'm also studying applied psychology as my minor.

What is this website meant to do?
======
I'm now working on my Wechat personal official account [Cross the sea], but that can't satisfy my need for my own blog.


I'd like my website to contain several parts reflecting my life.


The following website may have:

[CV]:My introduction


[SKILLS]:What I am sutdying recently


[PLOG]: What did I shoot with my camera all over these months? Follow me with my eye!


[BOOKS AND MOVIES]: What I read lately and how I'm think about them.


[TRACKER]: I'm always willing to foster some good habits and always forget to keep track of them.A wesite may be available on both phone and computer.
